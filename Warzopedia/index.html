        <br />
        <p>
          In modern era the most important thing for a country to grow,
          flourish, develope its economy is a strong Military. Since a strong
          military not only help us to safeguard and completely utilize our land
          , natural resources, environment but also destroy others land,
          environment, natural resources if required. A military is a heavily
          armed, highly organised force primarily intended for warfare, also
          known collectively as armed forces. Capability development, which is
          often referred to as the military 'strength', is arguably one of the
          most complex activities known to humanity; because it requires
          determining: strategic, operational, and tactical capability
          requirements to counter the identified threats; strategic,
          operational, and tactical doctrines by which the acquired capabilities
          will be used; identifying concepts, methods, and systems involved in
          executing the doctrines; creating design specifications for the
          manufacturers who would produce these in adequate quantity and quality
          for their use in combat; purchase the concepts, methods, and systems;
          create a forces structure that would use the concepts, methods, and
          systems most effectively and efficiently; integrate these concepts,
          methods, and systems into the force structure by providing military
          education, training, and practice that preferably resembles combat
          environment of intended use; create military logistics systems to
          allow continued and uninterrupted performance of military
          organisations under combat conditions, including provision of health
          services to the personnel, and maintenance for the equipment; the
          services to assist recovery of wounded personnel, and repair of
          damaged equipment; and finally, post-conflict demobilisation, and
          disposal of war stocks surplus to peacetime requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Development of military doctrine is perhaps the more important of all
          capability development activities, because it determines how military
          forces were, and are used in conflicts, the concepts and methods used
          by the command to employ appropriately military skilled, armed and
          equipped personnel in achievement of the tangible goals and objectives
          of the war, campaign, battle, engagement, action or a duel.
        </p>

          Basically in Warzopedia we have made efforts to classify countries
          according to their strength and to discuss the top weapons , nuclear
          powers and technologies used by these countries that make them real
          strong and different from other countries. Before getting into further more details let us quickly see why it is important to have strong military power in detail.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-center">Importance Of Strong Military Power</h4>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
          <li><strong>Economic:</strong> A state that can protect its territory, resources and trade routes has a major economic advantage over others
          that are unable to do so. Furthermore, military power can be a catalyst for economic growth, if applied properly.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Demographic:</strong> A state with a relatively high degree of military power has the capability to protect its population and to
          allow for its population to grow at a healthy pace.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Environmental and Natural Resources:</strong> A strong military allows a country to protect its environmental and resource
          wealth, while giving it the option to seize the environmental and resource wealth of its weaker rivals.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Political:</strong> For better or worse, armed forces have played a major role in determining the level of political stability in
          states throughout history. When political-military relations are strong and stable, a country is able to achieve a
          higher degree of political power.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Technology:</strong> The armed forces have been the catalyst and the source for many of the major technological achievements
          reached throughout human history and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Cultural:</strong> Military power plays a lesser role in determining a country’s level of cultural power, although states with
          dominant military positions are often able to force their cultural norms on weaker states.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Many states throughout history have used their advantages in terms of military power to achieve great power status. For
        example, Macedonia under Philip II and Alexander was considered a backwater by other Greek powers, but its military
        advantages allowed it to become the most powerful of all of the ancient Greek states. Prussia too was considered a
        backwater by other European and German states, but its development of a strong military allowed it to unify Germany and
        emerge as continental Europe’s most powerful state. The Soviet Union’s great power status was also based upon a
        foundation of military power, something that it allowed it to emerge as a global superpower in the wake of the Second
        World War.</p>
        <p>While some great powers built their foundations on military power, other great powers were undermined by this same
        power. Some states focused too many resources on their militaries, thus undermining other aspects of their power.
        Examples of this include the latter Roman Empire, 16th-17th century Spain, and, more recently, the Soviet Union itself.
        Other great powers failed to invest enough in their armed forces, and thus undermined their ability to fend off rival
        powers. For example, the Byzantine Empire’s military weakness allowed for the Arabs to seize most of its territory in
        the 7th century, while China’s military decline opened the door for the Mongols to seize control of China in the 13th
        century. In more modern times, France’s inability to match German military power cost that country its leadership
        position in continental Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
        
          <p>Today, there is a great disparity in the level of military power among the world’s leading countries. In most areas of
          military power, the United States is dominant, as it spends more on its armed forces than the next eight-largest
          military spenders combined. Nevertheless, the United States has learned that, while its armed forces may be able to win
          just about any battle against rival militaries, it is not large enough to maintain a dominant military position in
          multiple areas of the world today. In the meantime, a new rival to the US military is emerging in China. While China is
          now the clear number two in terms of military power, its level of military power in most areas is still dwarfed by that
          of the United States. However, Chinese defense spending is now more than one-third of that of the US, and this gap is
          expected to close in the years ahead. As for the rest of the world, their level of military power is far eclipsed by the
          US and China, and no other country is able to project continuous military power far from its borders, apart from the US
          and China. It is therefore no surprise that, as with many other aspects of power in the 21st century, the United States
          and China remain the world’s dominant military powers and will remain so for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>Below is a table showing details about some of the most powerful countries in the world.
