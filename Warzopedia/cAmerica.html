        <h2 class="text-center">United States of America(USA)</h2>
        The United States retains its top spot as the undisputed military power in the world - both numerically and
        technologically.
        The United States Armed Forces are the military forces of the United States of America. It consists of the Army,
        Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Space Force and Coast Guard. The president of the United States is the
        commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces and forms military policy with the Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of
        Homeland Security (DHS), both federal executive departments, acting as the principal organs by which military policy is
        carried out. All six armed services are among the eight uniformed services of the United States.
        </p>
        <p>Per Credit Suisse, the U.S. Armed Forces are the world's most powerful military. As of 2019, the U.S. military
        receives US$693 billion in order to fund its mandatory and discretionary accounts. As of 2018, the U.S. military
        accounts for roughly 36 percent of the world's defense expenditures. The U.S. Armed Forces has significant capabilities
        in both defense and power projection due to its large budget, resulting in advanced and powerful technologies which
        enables a widespread deployment of the force around the world, including around 800 military bases outside the United
        States. The U.S. Air Force is the world's largest air force, the U.S. Navy is the world's largest navy by tonnage,
        and the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps combined are the world's second largest air arm. In terms of size, the U.S.
        Coast Guard is the world's 12th largest naval force. The U.S. as of FY2019 has about 14,061 aircraft in its
        military inventory.</p>

        <p>Five hundred Minuteman III missiles are deployed at four bases in the north- central United States: Minot AFB and Grand
        Forks AFB, North Dakota, Malmstrom AFB, Montana, and F. E. Warren AFB, Wyoming. Operational since 1968, the model "G"
        differs from the "F" in the third stage and reentry system. The third stage is larger and provides more thrust for a
        heavier payload. The payload, the Mark 12 reentry system, consists of a payload mounting platform, penetration aids,
        three reentry vehicles (RVs) and an aerodynamic shroud. The shroud protects the RVs during the early phases of flight.
        The mounting platform is also a "payload bus" and contains a restartable hypergolic rocket engine powered by hydrazine
        and nitrogen tetroxide. With this configuration, the RVs can be independently aimed at different targets within the
        missile's overall target area or "footprint". This concept is known as Multiple Independently Targeted Reentry Vehicles
        (MIRV).
        </p>
        <p>
        The LGM-30 Minuteman missiles are dispersed in hardened silos to protect against attack and connected to an underground
        launch control center through a system of hardened cables. Launch crews, consisting of two officers, perform
        around-the-clock alert in the launch control center. A variety of communication systems provide the National Command
        Authorities with highly reliable, virtually instantaneous direct contact with each launch crew. Should command
        capability be lost between the launch control center and remote missile launch facilities, specially-configured EC-135
        airborne launch control center aircraft automatically assume command and control of the isolated missile or missiles.
        Fully qualified airborne missile combat crews aboard airborne launch control center aircraft would execute the NCA
        orders.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Minuteman weapon system was conceived in the late 1950s and deployed in the early 1960s. Minuteman was a
        revolutionary concept and an extraordinary technical achievement. Both the missile and basing components incorporated
        significant advances beyond the relatively slow-reacting, liquid-fueled, remotely-controlled intercontinental ballistic
        missiles of the previous generation. From the beginning, Minuteman missiles have provided a quick-reacting, inertially
        guided, highly survivable component to America's nuclear Triad. Minuteman's maintenance concept capitalizes on high
        reliability and a "remove and replace" approach to achieve a near 100 percent alert rate.</p>
        <p>By the time the last Minuteman IIs of the 564th SMS were placed on strategic alert in the spring of 1967, significant
        progress had been made on the development of an even more advanced ICBM. The Minuteman III, using modernized Minuteman I
        and Minuteman II ground facilities, provided reentry vehicle and penetration aids deployment flexibility, increased
        payload, and improved survivability in a nuclear environment. Its liquid injection attitude control system with a fixed
        nozzle on an improved third stage motor increased the Minuteman's range and the Minuteman III reentry system could
        deploy penetration aids and up to three Mark 12 or Mark 12A multiple independently-targetable reentry vehicles. A
        liquid-fueled post-boost propulsion system maneuvered the missile prior to deployment of the reentry vehicles, while
        upgraded guidance system electronics enhanced computer memory and accuracy.
        
        On 17 April 1970, an important Minuteman III milestone was reached when the first missile was placed in a silo assigned
        to the 741st Strategic Missile Squadron, Minot AFB, North Dakota. At the end of December, the 741st SMS became the first
        SAC Minuteman III squadron to achieve operational status.</p>
        <p>The current Minuteman force consists of 530 Minuteman III's located at F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyo.; Malmstrom AFB,
        Mont.; Minot AFB, N.D.; and Grand Forks AFB, N.D. As a result of U.S. initiatives to cancel development programs for new
        intercontinental ballistic missiles and retire the Peacekeeper ICBM, Minuteman will become the only land-based ICBM in
        the Triad. To compensate for termination of the Small ICBM and Peacekeeper Rail Garrison programs, DOD will conduct an
        extensive life extension program to keep Minuteman viable beyond the turn of the century. These major programs include
        replacement of the aging guidance system, remanufacture of the solid-propellant rocket motors, replacement of standby
        power systems, repair of launch facilities, and installation of updated, survivable communications equipment and new
        command and control consoles to enhance immediate communications.
      In order to meet warhead levels set by START II, the United States has decided to permanently DEMIRV Minuteman III
      missiles from their current capability to carry up to three reentry vehicles to a newly configured single reentry
      vehicle system once the treaty enters into force. "Downloading" Minuteman III missiles from three reentry vehicles to
      one lowers the military value of each missile; reduces the likelihood of any country expending resources to preemptively
      attack America's ICBM force; and decreases the probability of future US leaders being force into a "use or lose"
      position. For a downsized force of 500 single reentry vehicle Minuteman III to continue to be an effective deterrent
      force, the guidance replacement program will improve the needed accuracy and supportability that is inherent in a
      smaller missile force. Peacekeeper missiles will be deactivated by 2003, provided START II is ratified and enters into
      force. Ultimately, a total of 500 single RV Minuteman IIIs will be the nation's ICBM deterrent force through 2020.</p>

        <p>Today's US Air Force, the F-22 — one of the most advanced fighters ever made — runs on a similar disparity. But of
        course, the Air Force will remind you that it isn't science fiction. It's what they do every day.
        
        The F-22 program was killed at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in an effort to reshape the US military.
        The F-22 was designed as an air superiority fighter to take on advance fighters from China and Russia in air combat, not
        support troops on the ground.</p>
        <p>The F-22 is the fastest combat aircraft in the US Air Force, even after the development of the F-35. It can detect and
        attack enemy aircraft from miles away, even if the enemy isn't yet able to detect the incoming Raptor. In one instance, a Raptor was able to pop up from underneath two Iranian F-4 Phantoms and tell them to go home, which
        they promptly did, presumably to change their shorts.
</p>
<p>Their stealth and air combat abilities would then be used to escort C-17s and frustrate Chinese fighters, as well as any
Chinese efforts to jam their communications. That's due in large part to the pilots' advanced training and the advanced
stealth technology aboard the airframe. But the reason Chinese hackers couldn't hack their computers is something
different altogether. When the $65 billion fighter was cut from the Pentagon budget, there was a lot of joking surrounding the fighter, that
the United States had developed a weapon it would never use in combat — after all, until that point the F-22 hadn't
flown a combat mission over either of the two wars the US was actually fighting.</p>
<p>The F-22's high cruise speed and operating altitude over prior fighters improve the effectiveness of its sensors and
weapon systems, and increase survivability against ground defenses such as surface-to-air missiles. The ability
to supercruise, or sustain supersonic flight without using afterburners, allows it to intercept targets which subsonic
aircraft would lack the speed to pursue and afterburner-dependent aircraft would lack the fuel to reach. The F-22's
thrust and aerodynamics enable regular combat speeds of Mach 1.5 at 50,000 feet (15,000 m). The use of internal
weapons bays permits the aircraft to maintain comparatively higher performance over most other combat-configured
fighters due to a lack of parasitic drag from external stores. The airplane's structure contains a significant amount of
high-strength materials to withstand stress and heat of sustained supersonic flight. Respectively, titanium alloys and
composites comprise 39% and 24% of the structural weight.

The F-22's aerodynamics, relaxed stability, and powerful thrust-vectoring engines give it excellent maneuverability and
energy potential across its flight envelope. The airplane has excellent high alpha (angle of attack) characteristics,
capable of flying at trimmed alpha of over 60° while maintaining roll control and performing maneuvers such as the
Herbst maneuver (J-turn) and Pugachev's Cobra. The flight control system and full-authority digital engine control
(FADEC) make the aircraft highly departure resistant and controllable, thus giving the pilot carefree handling.</p>
