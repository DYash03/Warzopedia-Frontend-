      <p>
        A kill switch, also known as an emergency stop (e-stop), emergency off
        (EMO) and as an emergency power off (EPO), is a safety mechanism used to
        shut off machinery in an emergency, when it cannot be shut down in the
        usual manner. Unlike a normal shut-down switch or shut-down procedure,
        which shuts down all systems in order and turns off the machine without
        damage, a kill switch is designed and configured to abort the operation
        as quickly as possible (even if it damages the equipment) and to be
        operated simply and quickly (so that even a panicked operator with
        impaired executive functions or a by-stander can activate it).
      </p>
      <h4>Kill Switches in weapons</h4>

      <p>
        Often countries sell complex weapons to other countries in exchange for
        huge sum of money to increase their economy and foreign relations. But
        by doing that they put there defence in great risk as the countries
        buying these complex weapons can use it against them. So inorder to
        protect them against their own weapons these countries (manufacturers)
        started installing a special technology known as kill switch in these
        complex weapons. This is done in order to protect them from there own
        weapons in war like situations against the countries who bought them.
      </p>
      <h4>Use of kill in past</h4>
      <h5>Case1:</h5>
      <h6>French radar to Syria</h6>
      <p>
        Israeli jets bombed a suspected nuclear installation in northeastern
        Syria. Among the many mysteries still surrounding that strike was the
        failure of a Syrian radar—supposedly state-of-the-art—to warn the Syrian
        military of the incoming assault. It wasn’t long before military and
        technology bloggers concluded that this was an incident of electronic
        warfare—and not just any kind. Post after post speculated that the
        commercial off-the-shelf microprocessors in the Syrian radar might have
        been purposely fabricated with a hidden “backdoor” inside. By sending a
        preprogrammed code to those chips, an unknown antagonist had disrupted
        the chips’ function and temporarily blocked the radar.
      </p>
      <p>
        That same basic scenario is cropping up more frequently lately, and not
        just in the Middle East, where conspiracy theories abound. According to
        a U.S. defense contractor who spoke on condition of anonymity, a
        “European chip maker” recently built into its microprocessors a kill
        switch that could be accessed remotely. French defense contractors have
        used the chips in military equipment, the contractor told IEEE Spectrum.
        If in the future the equipment fell into hostile hands, “the French
        wanted a way to disable that circuit,” he said. Spectrum could not
        confirm this account independently, but spirited discussion about it
        among researchers and another defense contractor last summer at a
        military research conference reveals a lot about the fever dreams
        plaguing the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD).
      </p>
      <p>
        The above article says that French radar manufaturers had used a CPU
        which had bug and Isareli found it !!! Well, reality was that a CPU was
        trojan was used and then French sold the trojan activation codes to
        Isralies !!!
      </p>
      <h5>Case 2:</h5>
      <h6>Exonet missiles</h6>
      <p>
        In 1982, during the Falklands War, Argentine Navy Dassault-Breguet Super
        Étendard warplanes carrying the AM39 Air Launched version of the Exocet
        caused damage which sank the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Sheffield on 4 May
        1982. Two Exocets then struck the 15,000-ton merchant ship Atlantic
        Conveyor on 25 May. Two MM38 ship-to-ship Exocet missiles were removed
        from the old destroyer ARA Seguí, a retired US Navy Allen M.
        Sumner-class vessel, and transferred to an improvised launcher for land
        use, a technically challenging task which also required reprogramming.
        One of these was fired at, and caused damage to, the destroyer HMS
        Glamorgan on 12 June.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the incident immediately actions were taken. Margaret Thatcher
        reportedly bullied the French president to reveal the kill switches of
        French-supplied Exocet missiles that the Argentines were using against
        British warships, and disabled the Exocets. After which no British
        destroyer was even closely hit. Not only France did not sell more Exonet
        missiles as they had promised, they stopped Argentina from getting
        missiles from other countries such as Peru and also refused to service
        them. And many missiles fired after first few did not work properly.
        Because French had sold kill codes to British.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Weapons from any country have such killcodes. eg Russia had planted
        killcodes in missiles that Russia had sold to Iraq. And when Gulf War
        started, Russia sold those killcodes to USA and Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use of kill switches in weapons is one of the most fascinating
        technology and also dangerous at the same time. The article alomst
        covers all the important details on kill switch. There may be many more
        cases from the past reflecting the use of kill switch. The most famous
        are mentioned above.
      </p>
      <p>
        At last Warzopedia do not promote buying weapons from other countries
        especially by developing countries. As it can hurt them severly during
        actual war. From the above two examples it is quiet clear that these
        countries not only keep kill codes for themselves but also sell it to
        other countries for money or out of fear.
