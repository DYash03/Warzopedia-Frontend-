      <p>
        Nuclear weapon, device designed to release energy in an explosive manner
        as a result of nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, or a combination of the
        two processes. Fission weapons are commonly referred to as atomic bombs.
        Fusion weapons are also referred to as thermonuclear bombs or, more
        commonly, hydrogen bombs; they are usually defined as nuclear weapons in
        which at least a portion of the energy is released by nuclear fusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nuclear weapons produce enormous explosive energy. Their significance
        may best be appreciated by the coining of the words kiloton (1,000 tons)
        and megaton (1,000,000 tons) to describe their blast energy in
        equivalent weights of the conventional chemical explosive TNT. For
        example, the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945,
        containing only about 64 kg (140 pounds) of highly enriched uranium,
        released energy equaling about 15 kilotons of chemical explosive. That
        blast immediately produced a strong shock wave, enormous amounts of
        heat, and lethal ionizing radiation. Convection currents created by the
        explosion drew dust and other debris into the air, creating the
        mushroom-shaped cloud that has since become the virtual signature of a
        nuclear explosion. In addition, radioactive debris was carried by winds
        high into the atmosphere, later to settle to Earth as radioactive
        fallout. The enormous toll in destruction, death, injury, and sickness
        produced by the explosions at Hiroshima and, three days later, at
        Nagasaki was on a scale never before produced by any single weapon. In
        the decades since 1945, even as many countries have developed nuclear
        weapons of far greater strength than those used against the Japanese
        cities, concerns about the dreadful effects of such weapons have driven
        governments to negotiate arms control agreements such as the Nuclear
        Test-Ban Treaty of 1963 and the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of
        Nuclear Weapons of 1968. Among military strategists and planners, the
        very presence of these weapons of unparalleled destructive power has
        created a distinct discipline, with its own internal logic and set of
        doctrines, known as nuclear strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first nuclear weapons were bombs delivered by aircraft. Later,
        warheads were developed for strategic ballistic missiles, which have
        become by far the most important nuclear weapons. Smaller tactical
        nuclear weapons have also been developed, including ones for artillery
        projectiles, land mines, antisubmarine depth charges, torpedoes, and
        shorter-range ballistic and cruise missiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given below is a table showing the number of nuclear warheads, nuclear
        tests , Yield by every country.

      <p>
        The table clearly shows the domination of USA and Russia as far as
        nuclear weapons are concerned. Since both these countries have
        comparatively more nuclear warheads, done more tests, have higher
        nuclear yield then any other country in the world.
